# NAUTIPILOT 
## Autopilot for MSFS Boats & Ships

### Description
A SimConnect application which enables automatic navigation for seafaring vessels in MSFS. It constantly measures the deviation between TRK and BRG, then makes automatic rudder inputs as required to stay on course.

### Download and Operation
Download the latest release from this page, then follow the README inside. TLDR it's super simple, just extract and run.

### Supported Vessels
This has been tested with the SS France by RM Marine, but it *should* work with all RM Marine vessels and probably most other MSFS boats/ships. Please report any issues on Discord to TiJayFLY#3732.
